    title: "THE GIRL IN THE SOCICETY AND THE SYSTEMS AROUND HER",
    body: `
      More often than not, girls in the society today are discriminated against in Nigeria in
      access to educational opportunities, food, and nutrition. And, they are more often than not used
      as maids in the carrying out of heavy chores, carrying on responsibilities as maids commonly
      referred to as house-helps in most parts of Nigeria. Girls are married off at early an age, which
      interferes with their education or acquisition of skills needed for survival.
      Belief must be changed about the value of girl child. Rapid economic development is greatly
      dependent upon elimination of gender bias. Female education serves as an investment that will
      help facilitate the achievement of family planning objectives and the production of healthier
      children. Poor female nutrition contributes to greater vulnerability to disease and to poor
      physical and mental development. These and more create the need for Non-Governmental
      Organizations such as Great Women on a Mission to exist, to further improve the lives of impoverished girls and young women.
      Early marriage should be outlawed, and parents should be educated about the benefits of later
      marriage. A National or Regional body can be set up for defending the rights of the girl child in
      an educational, social, cultural, political, and economic context. The body should maintain
      statistics on child survival and other socioeconomic factors.
      Parents have an important role to fulfill in helping female children achieve the basic necessities
      of survival and development and in learning about the fundamentals of child development and
      care. Teachers have an important role to play in teaching about sex education, drug education,
      family planning, and AIDS.
      Women&#39;s groups have an important role to play in focusing attention on various problems
      confronting girl children. Government must focus more resources on reducing the inequalities
      between boys and girls, change discriminatory laws, and establish political stability. International
      and Non-Governmental Aid should increase and be directed to female child survival.`,

    title: "HINDRANCES TO THE EDUCATION SHE DESERVES",
    body: `Millions of girls around the world are being denied an education because they are exploited,
    discriminated against or simply being ignored which is surprisingly, among the most common
    reasons
    Millions of girls aren't at school today. They are shut out of education because of
    discrimination, poverty, emergencies and culture. These girls have the same hopes and dreams
    as boys. They want to learn, fulfill their potential, work and help their families and
    communities. But too often they are treated as second-class. They are exploited, abused and
    simply disregarded in many countries.\n
    Figures from UNICEF show that about 32 million girls of primary school age and 29 million
    of lower secondary school age are not getting an education. However, more recent reports put
    the number of young girls who do not have the opportunity to go to school and 130 million
    Some of the reasons why girls are not given the education they deserve include:\n
    1. Early Marriage
    Too often marriage is seen as a higher priority than education. The low value attached to girls’
    schooling means few other options are available to them.
    Boys can be affected but most victims of child marriage are girls. It is estimated that every
    year 15 million girls are married before they turn 18. After their wedding they leave the
    education system and, because they have fewer educational skills, they and their families are
    more likely to live in poverty.
    There are child marriages in every part of the world, including Europe and North America.
    But the highest rates of girls under 18 getting married are in Niger (76%), Central African
    Republic and Chad (both 68%).\n
    2. Pregnancy
    One million girls under 15 give birth each year. In many parts of the world, girls who are
    pregnant - regardless of their circumstances and their academic performance, will be excluded
    from school.
    Many do not return after giving birth due to those rules, stigma, fees, lack of childcare and the
    unavailability of flexible school programs.
    About 16 million girls aged 15 to 19 and some one million girls fewer than 15 give birth
    every year—most in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health
    Organization.\n
    3. Violence at School
    Not only is this a violation of their human rights, it is also one of the most common causes for
    girls to drop out of school.
    An estimated 246 million girls and boys are harassed and abused on their way to and at school
    every year - with girls particularly vulnerable. In Africa, half of all children said they had
    been bullied at school.
    18 million girls aged 15 to 19 are victims of sexual violence - often leading to school dropout
    and reinforcing cultural practices such as early marriage. \n
    4. Lack of funding
    Too many girls are being left behind because funding is targeted to boys&#39; education. Funding
    is an important issue when looking at reasons why girls aren’t in school. Education for girls is
    often the lowest budget priority in many countries.
    Daughters are perceived to be less valuable once educated, and less likely to abide by the will
    of the father, brother or husband. Often male siblings will be given the chance to attend
    school instead.
    But educating girls and young women increases a country&#39;s productivity and contributes to
    economic growth. Some countries lose more than $1 billion a year by failing to educate girls
    to the same level as boys. \n
    5. Child/domestic Labor
    Millions of girls spend every day working to help feed themselves and their families. Girls
    often stay home to take care of younger siblings and bear the main burden of housework.
    While educating a boy is considered a sound investment, it is sometimes considered to be a
    waste of time for girls.
    Many girls begin working as early as five years old - mainly in agriculture or in homes as
    domestic servants. Child domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to trafficking, forced
    labor, sexual violence and many health issues.
    There are more than 168 million child laborers - 11% of all children in the world - who are
    working instead of learning. There are significantly more girls than boys working in service
    industries.`

    title: "THE GIRL, THE OBSTACLE AND HER EDUCATION",
    body:
    `Children living in poverty face many barriers to education, but the stakes are especially high for
    girls. Globally, there are 130 million girls who are not currently enrolled in school. Investing in
    their futures has the potential to uplift their families and the world.
    When girls receive quality educations, they see the benefits in all aspects of their lives. Women
    who complete secondary education are less likely to experience intimate partner violence and
    they report higher levels of psychological well-being. They go on to make higher incomes, and
    their children are healthier. 
    Keeping girls in school supports economic growth, promotes peace, and even helps fight climate
    change. To protect future generations, we must first invest in resources and policies that help
    prevent the obstacles below. 
    
    Child Marriage
    Child marriage, the marriage of a child under the age of 18, happens all over the world but
    occurs disproportionately in developing countries. Parents let their daughters enter child
    marriages for various reasons. Some believe they are protecting their children from harm or
    stigma associated with having a relationship outside of marriage, but child brides who miss out
    on education are also more likely to experience early pregnancy, malnourishment, domestic
    violence, and pregnancy complications. For families experiencing financial hardship, child
    marriage reduces their economic burden, but it ends up being more difficult for girls to gain
    financial independence without education.
    There are about 700 million women around the world who were married as girls,
    UNICEF reported in 2017. In sub-Saharan Africa, 4 in 10 girls are married under the age of 18,
    and South Asia, where about 30% of girls under 18 are married, has the highest levels of child
    marriage, according to UNICEF.
    Menstruation
    Once a month from the time a girl reaches puberty, there is a chance she will miss school and
    work for a significant portion of her life because she has her period. 
    Menstruation is stigmatized around the world and the cultural shame attached to the natural
    process makes girls feel too embarrassed to fully participate in society. In Nepal, for example,
    menstruating women are seen as impure by their community and banished to huts during their
    cycles. 
    Gender Based Violence
    Gender-based violence can take many forms, including physical and sexual abuse, harassment,
    and bullying. Surviving rape, coercion, discrimination, and other types of abuse affects girls’
    enrollment, lowers their participation and achievements, and increases absenteeism and dropout
    rates. 
    
    It is estimated that 246 million girls and boys are harassed and abused on their way to school
    every year, but girls are disproportionately targeted. Tanzania found that almost 1 in 4 girls who
    experienced sexual violence reported the incident while traveling to or from school, and nearly
    17% reported at least one incident occurred at school or on school property. 
    Parents are less likely to let their daughters travel to school if they have to travel long unsafe
    distances.`
